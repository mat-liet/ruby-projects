# Ruby Projects
## Background

This project contains a number of very small projects written in Ruby. These were written as an exercise and to help develop my knowledge of Ruby.

These projects were taken from The Odin Project.

## Bubble sort

Uses a simple sorting algorithm to sort an array of numbers.

## Caesar Cypher

The Caesar cypher is one of the simplest and most known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

## Stock picker

A class that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It returns a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

## Substrings

A class that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (a dictionary) as the second argument. It returns a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

## Tic tac toe

This project took a bit longer to implement than the rest. This is a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.

Each player can select a name and the symbol that they would like to use.

Note: Tic tac toe is not fully complete. There are some checks that need to be added to make the game failsafe.
